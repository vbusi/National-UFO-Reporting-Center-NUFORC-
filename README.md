# National-UFO-Reporting-Center-NUFORC-

The National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) is an organization in USA founded in 1974 by Robert J. Gribble investigates UFO sightings and/or alien contacts. It has reported 90,000 UFO sightings and which are mostly in the United States. NUFORC also keeps records and provides statistics and graphs to assist others who are researching for information.  I collected the Dataset from Kaggle website where this Dataset consisted over 80,000 records of UFO sightings for the last century. The complete data consists entries where the location of sighting was blank with 0.8146% or have errors or blank time with 8.0237%. As this dataset is of 20th century, the older data might be obscured. The data consists the information of City, State, Time, Description and duration in seconds and hours of each sighting, comments which says what exactly happened during the sightings.
